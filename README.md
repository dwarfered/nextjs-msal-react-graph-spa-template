# Next.js MSAL React SPA Template (Microsoft Entra ID + Microsoft Graph)

> A production-ready Next.js SPA template for Microsoft Entra ID authentication (MSAL React) and Microsoft Graph.

**Live demo:** https://spa.identityworkbench.com/  
**Built for:** real-world identity-enabled applications, not just samples

It provides a clean, working foundation to sign users in, acquire delegated tokens, and immediately start rendering Microsoft Graph data using modern React patterns (hooks, SWR, Fluent UI).

Built to reflect how identity-enabled applications are actually implemented, not just how they are documented.

## Author’s Note

This template brings together patterns, lessons, and real-world experience working with MSAL, React, and Microsoft Graph into a single, practical starting point.

Instead of piecing together multiple samples and docs, the goal is to provide a clean foundation that just works.

If it saves you time or helps you avoid common pitfalls, it’s done its job.

## Who this is for

- Engineers building Microsoft Entra ID-integrated SPAs
- Teams needing a quickstart for MSAL React + Microsoft Graph
- Anyone tired of stitching together multiple identity samples

## Why this repo

- **Pre-configured identity plumbing** – MSAL is pre-configured with redirect handling, active-account management, and silent SSO so you can focus on product work.
- **Graph-ready data layer with typed hooks and resilient fetching** – Typed hooks and a resilient fetcher abstract access tokens, pagination, and transient failures.
- **Fluent UI-based application shell** – Fluent UI navigation, responsive layout, loading states, and reusable error dialogs already wired up.

## Feature highlights

- ✅ **Next.js 16 + React 19** App Router with client components where needed and a global provider stack in `app/layout.tsx`.
- ✅ **MSAL React 5** wrapper (`quickstart/providers/msal/MsalClientProvider.tsx`) that initializes once, handles redirect promises, and keeps the active account in sync.
- ✅ **Microsoft Graph helpers**
  - `quickstart/providers/msgraph/msGraphFetcher.ts` injects access tokens, retries pagination via `@odata.nextLink`, and now adds exponential backoff + friendly throttling hints for 429/5xx responses.
  - `quickstart/hooks/useGraphData.ts` wraps SWR for caching, revalidation, and typed responses.
  - `quickstart/hooks/useScopes.ts` detects missing consent and triggers interactive flows.
- ✅ **Fluent UI 9 design system** with a sticky app shell (`quickstart/ui/layouts/ClientShell.tsx`), adaptive nav (`quickstart/ui/navigation/NavMenu.tsx`), and sign-in/out controls fed by MSAL account data.
- ✅ **Route protection baked in** – the `app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx` group wraps every protected page with `AuthenticatedClientShell`, which uses `MsalAuthenticationTemplate` to require sign-in (and display helpful loading/error states) even on deep links.
- ✅ **Sample Graph pages**
  - `app/(authenticated)/profile/page.tsx` renders `/me` data with incremental consent prompts.
  - `app/(authenticated)/organization/page.tsx` calls `/organization` to show tenant metadata (requires `Organization.Read.All`).
- ✅ **Utility components** such as the global `ErrorDialogProvider` and `LoadingScreen` keep UX consistent during auth flows.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.18+ or 20+ (matches Next.js 16 requirements) and npm 9+.
- A Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant with permissions to create app registrations.
- An account with permission to grant delegated Microsoft Graph scopes (User.Read, Organization.Read.All, etc.).

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Register an Entra ID application

1. Visit [Azure Portal › Entra ID › App registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps).
2. **New registration** ➜ name it (e.g., `Next.js MSAL Graph SPA`).
3. Supported account types: choose _Single tenant_ (recommended for demos) or _Multi-tenant_ depending on your scenario.
4. Redirect URI (type _Single-page application_): `http://localhost:3000`.
5. After creating the app:
   - Copy the **Application (client) ID**.
   - Under **Authentication**, add your production redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` `https://yourdomain.com`).
   - Under **API permissions**, add delegated Microsoft Graph scopes:
     | Permission | Reason |
     |------------|--------|
     | `User.Read` | Load profile data via `/me` |
     | Any extra scopes your solution needs | Add them now or later |

### 3. Configure environment variables

Duplicate `.env.example` as `.env.local` (or any `.env*.local`) and adjust values:

```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="Next.js MSAL React SPA Quickstart"
NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID="<directory (tenant) ID or 'common' if a multi-tenant app>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID="<application (client) ID>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MSAL_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MSAL_SCOPES="User.Read"
```

Notes:

- The app now fails fast if `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID`, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_MSAL_SCOPES` are missing—restart `npm run dev` whenever you edit `.env.local` so Next.js reloads them.
- All variables are read in `config/appConfig.ts` and consumed across MSAL + Graph helpers.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MSAL_SCOPES` is a comma-separated list; align it with the permissions you granted. The profile page checks these scopes via `useScopes` before rendering data.
- For multi-environment deployments, create `.env.development.local` / `.env.production.local` or workspace secrets.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and select **Sign in**. Once consented, explore **Profile** and **Organization** from the sidebar.

## Available scripts

| Script          | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts Next.js with hot reload and client-side MSAL initialization logs.       |
| `npm run build` | Production build (generates `.next/`). Useful for CI/CD validation.            |
| `npm run start` | Serves the production build; ensure env vars are set in your hosting platform. |

```

## Authentication & Graph architecture

1. **AppProviders** wraps the tree with `MsalClientProvider`, Fluent UI theme, and the `ErrorDialogProvider` so every route can surface failures.
2. **MsalClientProvider** ensures `PublicClientApplication` initializes once per browser, handles `handleRedirectPromise`, sets the active account, and tries silent SSO if possible.
3. **ClientShell** renders a toolbar (`NavBar`) + sidebar (`NavMenu`). `NavMenu` filters routes that require auth using `useIsAuthenticated` so anonymous users only see what they can access.
4. **Sign-in/out buttons** reuse `handleSignIn` / `handleSignOut` (redirect flows) and display profile photos fetched from `/me/photos/48x48/$value` via SWR.
5. **Graph calls**
   - `useGraphData(resource)` → `msGraphFetcher` → fetch with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
   - `msGraphFetcher` injects tokens, optional `ConsistencyLevel`, paginates automatically, and throws descriptive errors surfaced by cards/dialogs.
6. **Consent flow**: `useScopes` checks delegated scopes silently, shows descriptive CTA cards, and can force consent when needed.

## Customization playbook

- **Rename the app**: change `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` or override the fallback string in `config/appConfig.ts`.
- **Add pages**: duplicate the pattern inside `app/(authenticated)/` and register new routes in `config/NavItems.tsx` with `requiresAuth` flags.
- **Call additional Graph endpoints**: extend `msGraphEndpoints` and reuse `useGraphData` for SWR-powered UI updates.
- **Handle errors centrally**: import `useErrorDialog()` anywhere inside the provider tree to show blocking issues (token failures, Graph throttling, etc.).
- **Style it**: adjust Fluent UI tokens in `quickstart/styling/fluentui/styles.ts` or wrap `FluentProvider` with a custom theme.
- **Charts & data viz**: Recharts 3 is already installed—perfect for rendering usage reports with Graph analytics data.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No active account found"** – Sign in first; `msalInstance` cannot fetch tokens without an account. This is thrown by `getMsGraphAccessToken`.
- **`interaction_required` errors** – The user must consent to new scopes. The Profile page surfaces a "Grant profile access" card that calls `requestConsent()`.
- **Organization screen empty** – Ensure an admin granted `Organization.Read.All`. Without it, Graph returns HTTP 403.
- **Redirect URI mismatch** – Update the SPA redirect in Azure Portal to exactly match `NEXT_PUBLIC_MSAL_REDIRECT_URI` (including protocol + port).
